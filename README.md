# **goBank is the project exercise of the go backend course by** [techschoolgutu](https://www.youtube.com/c/TECHSCHOOLGURU)

This repository contains the source code and my notes about the course of back-end with go that I toke. It could be improve, it could be safer and I could extend the functionalities but I think that is beyond my original propose of familiarize with golang
It could run either gin server or grpc server. The gin server has more functionality, it wasn't the idea to repeat the code all over again.

## **What is Go and how to [install](https://go.dev/doc/install) it**


Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. 
```
curl -Lo go.tgz https://go.dev/dl/go1.19.linux-amd64.tar.gz

sudo tar -C /usr/local -xvf go.tgz

go version

### ***Final clean up***

Once I finish the course I decided to cleanup the commit history -it had a lot of unnecessary test and tries- and when I eventually revisit this project to recap some of the implementations I would like to see a smooth gh page.

The steps that I use:
 First delete all branches -and tags if you have some- besides master. Then unprotect the master branch

```
git checkout --orphan finish
git add -A
git commit -S -m "finish"
git branch -D master
git branch -m master
git push -f origin master
git gc --aggressive --prune=all
```
